        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>As a part of the National Institute of Design's UI/UX curriculum, I joined a team of three to redesign an app
            targeting urban cycling safety for school children. The project, under the theme "Urban Arcadia," spanned
            over two weeks and aimed to address the critical question:</p>
        <h3 style="color: gray; font-weight: 600; padding-left: 20px; border-left:2px solid black"> How might we
            encourage safe cycling to schools and short-distance commutes?<br><br></h3>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Our preliminary research, which included interactions with school kids and parents and a review of existing
            research reports, uncovered an alarming number of road accidents involving young cyclists. Parents' fear for
            their children's safety emerged as a significant deterrent to encouraging cycling as a mode of transport.
            This understanding led us to focus on road safety for children.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Create an application that provides parents with peace of mind while allowing the child a sense of
            freedom. The app includes features like remote medical assistance and safehouses for the child.

        </p>

        <h2 id="research">User Research and Synthesis</h2>
        <p>To understand our users' needs, we created empathy maps for two primary personas - Parents and Children. We
            also compiled input from research and sythesised insights from it using Affinity mapping. This helped us
            understand their motivations and frustrations, enabling us to design a solution addressing their
            needs.<br><br></p>
        <p><strong>Affinity Map</strong>
            helped us group related research findings and ideas, enabling us to identify user needs and
            objectives, guiding our design process.<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/affinity_map 1.png" alt="Affinity map"><br><br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Empathy Map</strong>
            was used to gain insights into our users' behaviors and attitudes, leading to more informed
            design decisions.
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/Empathy_maps.png" alt="Empathy maps">

        </p>
        <div class="infobox">
            <p style="font-size:x-large">Key insights:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Parents:</strong> Excessive anxiety when their child doesn't return home on time.
                <strong>Children:</strong> Need to feel safe during their trips, a bad experience can discourage them
                from
                cycling in the future.<br><br>
                We identified several barriers to safe cycling:<br>
                1. Unpredictability of traffic movement.<br>
                2. Lack of information about optimal routes and current traffic conditions.<br>
                3. High vulnerability to road accidents.

        <h2 id="ideation">Ideation and Design</h2>
        <p>
            The scenario sketches played a pivotal role in our design process. We used them as a tool to dive deeper
            into our users' world, exploring various contexts and situations where our app could be beneficial. Starting
            from empathy maps, we built scenarios to simulate user journeys, identifying both pain points and
            opportunities.<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/aegis_scenario_sketches.png"
                alt="Scenarios">
        </p>
        <p>
            These sketches enabled us to visualize potential solutions and interactions within the users' everyday lives
            before developing the screen designs. In doing so, they ensured our design decisions remained
            contextually relevant.<br><br>
            Through sketching, we were able to quickly iterate and test different concepts. This helped us visualize
            user navigation and identify potential issues. After team discussions, we finalized the concepts to be
            carried forward in the design process<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/aegis_sketches.jpg" alt="Ideation sketches"><br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>Our initial concept was a <strong> blend of a physical product, a GPS-based cycle lock, and a mobile
                application. The lock would unlock if the user wore a helmet with a registered RFID tag and would alert
                parents in case of an accident</strong>. Initial sketches were low-fidelity and focused on functionality
            and layout. This phase allowed us to quickly iterate, visualize user flow, and decide on the concepts to be
            taken to the next design phase.<br><br>

            To provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, we developed:<br><br>
            <strong> Information Architecture:</strong> This formed the backbone of our app, structuring user
            interactions and information
            flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/aegis_information_architecture.png"
                alt="Information Architecture"><br><br>
            <strong>Low-Fidelity Mockups:</strong> These helped visualize the presentation of information and
            user-required
            interactions.It was also used to get feedback and testing to evaluate the usability of the product<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/Aegis_low_fidelity.jpg" alt="low-fidelity sketches">
        </p>

        <h2 id="refinement">Iterations and Refinements</h2>
        <p>Based on various feedback from sample users, peers + mentor feedback, some concerns were raised:<br>
            1. The product was complicated and unintuitive.<br>
            2. There was a risk of false positives from sensor interactions.<br>
            3. The inability to track users not wearing a helmet.<br><br>
            We addressed these issues by removing the helmet requirement and implementing a feature that alerts parents
            if a fall is detected with no subsequent movement.
        </p>

        <h2 id="finaldesign">Final design</h2>
        <p>
            Our final design encapsulates the essence of our research and iterations:<br><br>
            <strong> Card Layout:</strong> Important information is displayed using cards, focusing on one task at a
            time.<br>
            <strong>Safehouses:</strong> Landmarks and locations are visually indicated as safe areas for the child.<br>
            <strong>Emergency Assistance:</strong> Users can directly request help during emergencies.<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/Aegis_overview_1.png" alt="Aegis overview 2">
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the primary users were parents and their children, we wanted to ensure the palette was both welcoming
            and trustworthy. We chose a palette that was vibrant yet comforting, leveraging primary colors with a modern
            twist. We also wanted the type to convey a similar aesthetic, hence we chose<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Aegis/visual_design.png" alt="Visual-design">

            <strong>Color:</strong> We chose a calming palette to convey a sense of security and comfort.<br>
            <strong> Typography:</strong> We used Proxima Nova, known for its readability and modern aesthetics.<br>
        </p>

        <h2 id="reflection">Final design</h2>
        <p>
            This project was an enlightening journey through the UX/UI design process. It highlighted the importance of
            user-centric design, iterative development, and the invaluable role of user feedback. My skills in
            problem-solving and decision-making were honed, further enriching my understanding of the nuanced
            relationship between UX and UI design.
