        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p> The pandemic fuelled the demand for virtual events, prompting P&I, India's first ISO-certified Exhibition
            Design and Events company, to look for ways to improve its digital exhibition capabilities and create more
            innovative and immersive solutions.<br><br>
            <img class="fit" src="../images/graphic/Virt/Panel.jpg" alt="P&I physical work">
            <br><br><br>
            I was tasked with the design a versatile, user-friendly virtual events platform tailored to various business
            domains. The platform was to provide a customizable and immersive experience, while maintaining ease of
            navigation and accessibility, thereby enabling exhibitors, and attendees to engage effectively<br>
        </p>

        <!-- Problem -->

        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <p class="two-columns" style="padding: 0">
            P&I, an established name in Exhibition Design and Events, had to pivot to digital solutions due to the
            disruptive impact of the pandemic on physical events.
            <img style="padding: 0 0 0 2rem" width="50%" src="../images/graphic/Virt/PI Logo.jpg"
                alt="P&I physical work">
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Physical events have scalability issues and limited reach, leading to a rise in demand for virtual
                events during the pandemic.</li>
            <li> Existing virtual platforms often lacked user-friendly interfaces, engagement, and social interaction.
                These platforms also struggled with flexibility and customizability for hosting different types of
                events.</li>
            <li>Many users needed a lightweight, yet feature-rich event platform due to limited bandwidth during the
                pandemic.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/Clean desk with Dell display-min.png" alt="Overview">
        </p><br>

        <!-- Research -->

        <h2 class="smooth-scroll" id="research">Research</h2>

        <p>
            Addressing these problems required understanding the user's expectations and experiences with virtual events
            platforms. Hence, we designed a user research plan with specific research questions::<br>
        <ol class="fit infobox">
            <li><strong> User Expectations</strong>
                What do users expect from a virtual events platform?<br>
            <li><strong> User Navigation and Interaction</strong>
                How do users navigate and interact with existing virtual events platforms?<br></li>
            <li><strong> Important Features:</strong>
                What features and aspects of a virtual event are most important to users?<br></li>
            <li><strong> Social Interaction:</strong>
                How do users perceive and engage with networking and social interaction opportunities in a virtual
                context?<br></li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding user needs and pain points was our first step in creating an effective solution. Through
            remote interviews and online discussions, we gathered valuable insights about what users expected from a
            virtual event platform.<br> Since the project was conducted during the pandemic, it was challenging to
            conduct
            physical interviews and discussions with the stakeholders. From the initial research, we found <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Desired Features:</strong>
            Users expected an easy-to-use, reliable platform with minimal technical glitches,
            high-quality uninterrupted audio/video streaming, and interactive experiences.<br><br>
            <strong> Pain Points:</strong>
            Users expressed concerns over unstable connections, lack of interactive features, monotonous
            nature of online events, and security of their data.
        </p>

        <h3><strong> Competitor Analysis </strong></h3>
        <p>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/Competitors.png"
                alt="logos competitive analysis"><br><br>
            We conducted a competitive analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps that our platform could
            fill.
            The findings revealed that while basic engagement features were common, immersive experiences were lacking,
            customization options were not user-friendly, and video streaming quality was inconsistent.<br>

            This paved the way for design opportunities:<br>

            <strong>1. Unique Engagement:</strong> We could leverage Unity-based interactive 3D models.<br>
            <strong>2. Enhanced Interaction:</strong> Enhancing interaction during video sessions could increase
            engagement.<br>
            <strong>3. Intuitive Interface:</strong> A more intuitive interface which sufficient flexibility for
            different events could set
            us apart.
        </p>

        <h2>Insights and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Using these insights, we created user personas and prioritized features to guide our design decisions.</p>
        <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/virt_personas.png" alt="personas using the platform">
        <p>
            <strong>Feature Prioritization:</strong> We also compared features across different platforms and
            prioritized
            features like easy navigation, high-quality streaming, networking opportunities, and chat support
            center.etc.<br>
            <br>
            After several rounds of discussions, we decided to focus on attendees as they are the primary users driving
            event success. Their challenges in networking and navigating virtual stalls informed our design
            improvements. Enhanced attendee experience benefits all stakeholders by boosting engagement and
            participation.Hence,
        <h3 style="padding: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">"We decided to prioritize the app mainly for attendees and create user flows
            for the attendees"</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            We focused on designing a smooth user flow that prioritized the attendees' journey, from registration to
            attending the event and networking with other participants.
        </p>
        <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/User flow.png" alt="personas using the platform">

        <h2 class="smooth-scroll" id="sketches">Ideation</h2>
        <p>I began by sketching a grid-based layout that could adapt to different screen sizes. I conducted experiments
            to explore different placements for key elements such as navigation, content area, and chat functions.
            Additionally, I created sketches of various exhibit area layouts, utilizing cards or tiles to represent
            individual stalls. This initial exploration proved invaluable in visualizing the structure and interaction
            with media content.
        </p>
        <img class="fit" src="../images/graphic/Virt/Low-Fidelity explorations.png" alt="Low fidelity sketches">

        <p>I captured the core features of dashboard using the low fidelity sketches. These helped in getting quick
            feedback and help us narrow down the required features. This helped in creating the site map that helped in
            final design ideaitons.
        </p>
        <img class="fit" src="../images/graphic/Virt/Virtual Events Platform - Information Architecture.jpeg"
            alt="site map of the dashboard">


        <h2 class="smooth-scroll" id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            To build an intuitive and efficient interface, I incorporated the IBM's Carbon Design System in the
            platform's development. This robust design system, recognized for its comprehensive library of components
            and patterns, provided a solid foundation for our design process.<br><br>
            Choosing a sleek web design over a 3D heavy lobby for our Virtual events platform was primarily due to user
            accessibility, performance, content focus, ease of development, and inclusivity. A sleek design is easier to
            navigate, performs better across devices, keeps the focus on content, is simpler to maintain, and caters to
            users with varying tech proficiency. While 3D environments can be immersive it can also be cluttered whereas
            our design ensures a user-friendly, performance-optimized, and accessible experience for all attendees.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Responsive web platform</strong>
            To cater to users across various devices, our home screen design is responsive, adapting to desktops,
            tablets, and smartphones seamlessly. The user-centric design ensures easy navigation, irrespective of the
            device used.<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/Responsive.png" alt="site map of the dashboard">
            <br><br>
            <strong>Group chats and Networking area</strong>
            The chat and networking area mirror interfaces of popular apps like Zoom and WhatsApp, promoting familiarity
            and easy contact sharing. Search functions have been enhanced with auto-suggestions, directing users to
            relevant companies and profiles, thereby streamlining networking.<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/virt_networking.png" alt="Networking area">

                <p>Using law of familiarity to make the call and chat interfaces more intutive and usable</p>
            </i>
            <br><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Exhibit area screens</strong>
            The exhibit area displays products via a captivating, immersive 3D experience. We've optimized the viewport
            to prioritize product display, reducing distractions. A bookmarking feature on product profiles allows
            attendees to curate their exhibit journey, saving and revisiting their favourite stalls and products with
            ease.<br>
            <img class="fit deskpad" src="../images/graphic/Virt/virt_exhibition.png" alt="Exhibit area">
            <br><br>

        </p>

        <h2 class="smooth-scroll" id="usertesting">Iterative User Testing and Refinements</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Iterative User Testing and Refinements</strong><br>

            We facilitated user testing with our high-fidelity prototypes, obtaining critical feedback from potential
            attendees. The interactive stalls and networking features were particularly well-received, indicating our
            user-centric approach was effective. However, this exercise also illuminated areas requiring enhancements.
            The Keynote video section was one such aspect. Based on user feedback, we saw the necessity to incorporate a
            Call to Action (CTA) feature. By implementing this, we aimed to streamline the process for users to connect
            with relevant companies and speakers, further enhancing the overall user experience.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Auditorium section highlights pre-recorded keynote videos, ensuring a lag-free and high-quality viewing
            experience. By offering pre-recorded keynotes, the platform prioritizes uninterrupted learning and
            engagement while providing flexibility for users to pause, rewind, or rewatch segments at their
            convenience.<br><br>
